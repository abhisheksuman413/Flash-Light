# Flashlight App

This Android app allows users to control their device's flashlight with added features like blinking functionality and adjustable blink speed using a seek bar. It provides a user-friendly interface for seamless operation.

## Features

- Turn the flashlight **ON/OFF** with a simple toggle button.
- Enable **Blink Mode**, where the flashlight blinks at adjustable speeds.
- Use a **SeekBar** to fine-tune the blinking frequency.
- Includes a **Widget** for quick access to flashlight controls, including toggle and blink speed adjustments.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin** for Android app development.
- **XML** for designing the app's UI.
- **Camera2 API** for flashlight control.
- **SeekBar** for user-friendly frequency adjustments.
- **Widgets** for home screen functionality.
- **Handler and Looper** for managing the blinking mechanism.
- **Gradients** for dynamic UI updates.

## Prerequisites

- Android Studio installed.
- Basic knowledge of Android components like `CameraManager`, `Handler`, and `AppWidgetProvider`.

## Architecture

### Flashlight Control
The app uses Android's `Camera2 API` to control the flashlight. It checks for hardware compatibility and toggles the flashlight state using `setTorchMode`. 

- **Blinking Mechanism:** 
  - A `Handler` posts a `Runnable` to toggle the flashlight ON/OFF at intervals defined by the seek bar's progress.

### Widgets
A custom widget provides users with quick access to the flashlight features:
- **Toggle Flashlight**
- **Increase/Decrease Blink Speed**

The widget listens for broadcast intents, processes user actions, and updates the UI.
